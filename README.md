# GitHub Copilot Meta Prompts

## What are Meta Prompts

## What are we talking about?
- Developers gladly use GitHub CoPilot while new developing applications
- However, they indicate that GitHub Copilot works well for simpler use cases like new code generation, more complex use cases like reverse engineering, or optimizing existing code was still a challenge

## Yeah, I've heard about it, how are we solving it? 
The root cause analysis revealed
1. Developers weren't providing adequate problem context 
2. Senior Developers demanded clarity how Copilot was suggesting something, and weren't comfortable with the "black box" nature of Copilot
3. Developers mostly required the suggestions in particular format - like a JSON payload, and Copilot response wasn't matching

## This is where Meta Prompts come in

## Sounds interesting tell me more
- Meta Prompts are a recent Phenomenon (Check References below)
- They Emphasize Structure and Syntax of the prompt
- They Use Type Theory for clearer classification of the elements
- Are more effective in contexts where the emphasis is on the "how" rather than the what?

## How does this look in real life?!
