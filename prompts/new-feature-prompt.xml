    <objective>
        You are tasked with understanding the logic in the API methods defined in - 
        {{source-file-name}} and related files within the current repository.
        Your objective is to add new functionality to the existing source code files by understanding the existing logic flow, and substantiate that with a detailed, step-by-step solution approach. 

        The new functionality to be added is in {{source-file-name}} and related files within the current repository
        The new functionality is to add {{new-requirements}}

        It is a must that you provide a sequence diagram for the existing code flow, and then add the new functionality to the existing code flow.
        It is a must that you highlight any potential issues with the existing code flow, and include that in your solution-approach
        It is a must that you step in to each method and understand the logic flow, and then add the new functionality to the existing code flow.
        It is a must that the sequence diagram include any database related calls, and any external API calls.
        It is a must that all new code generated is in line with the recommendations in the {{coding-guidelines-files}}
