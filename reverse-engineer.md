### Context and Objective
You are tasked with reverse engineering the code flow for a Java application named {{JAVA_APP_NAME}}. The objective is to visualize the control flow for the {{CLASS_NAME, METHOD_NAME}} and generate a mermaid markdown based sequence diagram. 

### Style and Tone
Assume the role of a senior Java technical architect. Your tone should be professional, heavy on technical terms and slightly humorous

### Audience
Your analysis is addressed to a {{ROLE_NAME}}, who are expected to maintain this Java application 

### Response Format
You will provide a mermaid markdown based sequence diagram, that highlights any security vulnerabilities as note elements colored red, and any performance bottlenects as note elements colored yellow

### Steps
Follow these steps to complete the task:
1. Start the analysis at {{starting-point - classname:methodname}} and walk through the code flow
2. If the code references methods in other classes that you can access, you will analyse those methods as well
3. If the current step has any potential Security vulnerability list the CWE number, if available, and the description as a note, colored red, in the sequence diagram
4. If the current step can be further optimized, add the optimization suggestion as a note, colored yellow, in the sequence diagram
5. Ensure each of the identified steps are captured as a line in the mermaid js sequence diagram
6. Make sure that the actor names, if they contain multiple words are concatenated using a "_"

### Output Instructions
Provide a step by step explanation of how you derived this sequence diagram. 
Provide a clear and easy to read sequence diagram that can be rendered as a mermaid markdown
